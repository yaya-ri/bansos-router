## Quick start

```bash
npm i -g bansos-router
```

Start the daemon and point your coding harness at it:

```bash
bansos start --bg       # detached daemon on 127.0.0.1:17070
bansos setup opencode   # configure any supported harness
```

For **[pi](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi)**, install the companion extension ([`extensions/pi`](extensions/pi/README.md)):

```bash
pi install npm:pi-bansos-router
```

Supported harnesses for `bansos setup`: `claude-code`, `aider`, `opencode`, `codex`, `hermes`, `goose`, `openclaw`, `antigravity`, `jcode`, `9router`, `continue`, `cline`, and `roo`. See [docs/harnesses.md](docs/harnesses.md) for harness-specific details.

Open `http://127.0.0.1:17070` in your browser for the Web UI dashboard (model catalog, live latency ping, 1-click config generator, relay manager, playground).

### Always-on local protections

These hold in every mode (not just strict):

- **CORS only for loopback origins**: a page served from a non-loopback
  origin gets no CORS headers, so it can neither read nor write the daemon.
- **Host header validated**: loopback clients must present a loopback (or
  own-interface) Host header; anything else gets 403. This blocks DNS
  rebinding where a hostile page resolves to `127.0.0.1`.
- **Relay probe & mutation are SSRF-guarded**: probes may only target the
  active/saved relay or a public `https://` host; literal loopback, private,
  and link-local IPs (e.g. `169.254.x` metadata) are rejected unless
  explicitly saved. Relay URLs must be `http(s)://` without credentials.

## Docker

Run the daemon in a container instead of installing globally:

```bash
docker build -t bansos-router .
docker run -d --name bansos -p 17070:17070 -v bansos-data:/home/node/.bansos bansos-router
```

The container runs as the non-root `node` user (uid 1000); state lives in
`/home/node/.bansos` inside the container, which is what the volume above
mounts.

Or with compose:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

- Image is a multi-stage build on node:22-alpine (~58 MB compressed), CLI +
  daemon + Web UI included, zero runtime dependencies.
- The container runs the daemon in the foreground (Docker owns the lifecycle)
  bound to `0.0.0.0`, with tini for correct signal forwarding and a healthcheck
  on `/healthz`.
- State persists across restarts in the `bansos-data` volume; point your
  harnesses at `http://127.0.0.1:17070` as usual.
- `docker compose logs -f` replaces `bansos logs` inside the container.

## CLI reference

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `bansos start [--bg] [--port N] [--bind H] [--unsafe-allow-non-loopback]` | Run the daemon (foreground, or detached with `--bg`) |
| `bansos logs [--activity]` | Tail the daemon log in real time (every mode: daemon always logs to `~/.bansos/logs/bansosd.log`); `--activity` prints the structured request feed shown in the web UI "Activity" tab |
| `bansos stop [--all]` | Stop the daemon recorded in `state.json`; `--all` stops every bansos daemon on the machine |
| `bansos status [--json]` | Daemon status (port, model count, alive models); reports every running daemon on the auto-bump range (17070-17090) |
| `bansos models [--json]` | List live catalog from `/v1/models` |
| `bansos ping [model] [--json]` | Probe live latency and rate-limit status of all models (or a specific model) |
| `bansos refresh` | Ask the daemon to re-run health checks now |
| `bansos setup <harness...> [--model <id>] [--dry-run] [--undo]` | Write, update, or undo harness configs |
| `bansos relay <on\|off\|status\|url\|use\|list\|remove>` | Manage relay egress |
| `bansos doctor` | Diagnose daemon reachability and harness config validity |
| `bansos --version` | Print version |
| `bansos <command> --help` / `bansos help <command>` | Per-command usage, defaults, exit codes, examples |
| `bansosd` | Alias for the daemon (e.g. `bansosd --bg`) |

## Strict security mode

Strict mode is opt-in and fail-closed. Add a `security` block to
`~/.bansos/config.json` and explicitly list every provider that may receive
requests:

```json
{
  "port": 17070,
  "bind": "127.0.0.1",
  "security": {
    "mode": "strict",
    "allowedUpstreams": ["zen"],
    "allowCrossProviderFailover": false
  }
}
```

With `mode: "strict"`:

- Non-loopback binds rejected unless `--unsafe-allow-non-loopback` passed.
- Relay egress, probing, and mutation disabled across CLI, API, Web UI.
- Only exact upstreams in `allowedUpstreams` receive requests (empty list blocks all).
- Cross-provider failover disabled.
- Sensitive values and raw upstream errors suppressed from logs.
- **DLP redacts pasted credentials**: API keys, PATs, private keys, and
  credential assignments in a request are replaced with `[REDACTED:<type>]`
  before it leaves for an external upstream (zen/kilo/llm7). The request
  still goes through, so an agent that reads a secret (say, by grepping a
  config file) keeps working instead of being wedged by its own history. Loopback
  (self-hosted) gateways are exempt, since their own keys are legitimately
  part of the request body.

## What it does

- One local daemon on `127.0.0.1:17070`, started with `bansos start`. It speaks
  three wire protocols: OpenAI Chat Completions, Anthropic Messages, and OpenAI
  Responses (Codex CLI).
- Keyless free upstreams only: OpenCode Zen, KiloCode gateway, and LLM7.
- `bansos setup <harness>` writes config for Claude Code, Aider, OpenCode,
  Codex, Hermes, Goose, OpenClaw, Antigravity, JCode, 9Router, Continue, Cline, and Roo Code.
- Web UI dashboard served at `http://127.0.0.1:17070/` with model catalog explorer,
  live ping probes, 1-click harness setup generator, relay egress manager, and test playground.
  The catalog shows per-model capabilities (Think / Vision badges) and a live
  usage + activity tracker (requests, tokens, latency, error rate).
- The pi extension ([`pi-bansos-router`](extensions/pi/README.md)) registers the
  `bansosr` provider, so every free model shows up in pi's `/model` picker. There is
  also a `/bansosr` command for status. If the daemon is not running when pi
  starts, the extension starts it and stops it again on exit.
- The catalog is health-checked: live `:free` models replace stale seeds on a
  timer. Relay egress can route around rate limits, and there is a per-IP rate limiter.
- If a model is rejected with `401`/`403`/`429`/`5xx`, the daemon auto-fails over to the
  closest equivalent model on a different upstream (same reasoning level,
  context window, and effort capability), retrying up to two extra candidates
  before surfacing an error. Request duration (`durationMs`) is logged on every
  completion and rejection.
- A model that answers `429` is parked for a cooldown, so the next request
  starts on a fallback instead of spending another round trip to learn the same
  thing. `Retry-After` sets the duration when the upstream sends one, otherwise
  it is a minute, capped at fifteen. Parked models stay listed in `/v1/models`
  and are still used when nothing else qualifies.
- A `401`/`403` means the upstream will not serve that model from where the
  request egressed (OpenCode Zen, for instance, returns `403 This service is
  not available in your region` when Cloudflare routes through a region its
  providers block). Retrying cannot help, so the model is parked for 30 minutes
  and the request fails over instead of returning the error. Send
  `x-bansos-no-failover: 1` when you want the model's own status back. The
  upstream's own message is now logged alongside the status.

## Available models

By default, `bansos setup` automatically configures intelligent defaults per harness:
- **Claude Code**: Maps tiers automatically (`haiku` -> fast non-reasoning, `sonnet` -> daily reasoning, `opus` -> highest-capacity reasoning).
- **Multi-model harnesses** (`opencode`, `goose`, `openclaw`, `continue`, `9router`, `jcode`): Registers all available models (or dynamic `/v1/models` provider) with the smart default (currently `muse-spark-1.3-contributor-free`) as primary.
- **Single-model harnesses** (`aider`, `codex`, `hermes`, `antigravity`, `cline`, `roo`): Same smart default. Pass `--model <id>` to pin a specific model. Context and max output
are token counts. The seeded catalog is ~30 models and the live one changes as
upstreams rotate free tiers; run `bansos models` or `bansos ping` to see what is
alive right now.

### OpenCode Zen

| model id | reasoning | vision | context | max output |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `mimo-v2.5-free` | ✓ | ✓ | 200k | 32k |
| `nemotron-3-ultra-free` | ✓ | ✗ | 1M | 128k |
| `big-pickle` | ✓ | ✗ | 200k | 32k |
| `nemotron-3.5-lightning-free` | ✓ | ✗ | 262k | 262k |
| `ling-3.0-flash-fin-free` | ✓ | ✗ | 262k | 32k |
| `muse-spark-1.3-contributor-free` | ✓ | ✓ | 1M | 131k |
| `muse-spark-1.2-contributor-free` | ✓ | ✓ | 1M | 131k |

Muse Spark answers only on the Responses API (`/v1/responses`) and returns HTTP
500 on chat completions. bansos-router translates the upstream leg both ways, so
Muse works from any harness — chat completions, Responses, and Anthropic clients
all see their usual wire format, tool calls included.

Notes:

- The tables above mirror the seeds in `src/upstreams/*`, which were verified
  against each upstream's live catalog and specs on 2026-09-03 (reasoning /
  vision / context flags, dead promos removed). On refresh the daemon serves
  the live catalog, which can differ slightly as upstreams rotate free tiers.
- Kilo's `:free` models are liveness-gated: the daemon re-checks the kilo
  catalog on a timer and drops models that are no longer offered free.
- Zen seeds are re-checked against `GET /v1/models` on refresh. The listing is
  not exhaustive (some servable promos are never listed), so an unlisted seed
  is probe-verified keyless before being kept; a retired promo (e.g. `hy3-free`,
  gone and answering 401) disappears automatically.
- LLM7 models are filtered dynamically by `usage_based_only: false` (tier turbo);
  `default` and `fast` are stable selectors. `pro` tier is paid-only and excluded.
